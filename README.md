# Whack-a-Mole
Whack a Mole is a classic arcade-style game where players aim to 'whack' moles popping up from holes within a limited time. This interactive game tests your reflexes and reaction speed as the moles appear and disappear quickly. The goal is to score as many points as possible by hitting the moles before they retreat back into their holes.
